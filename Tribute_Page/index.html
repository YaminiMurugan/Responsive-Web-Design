            <p class="intro">
                <strong>Shakespeare </strong>was an English playwright and poet. He is generally considered the
                “greatest dramatist the
                world has ever known” and the “finest poet who has written in the English language”.
                He wrote 37 plays, which have been comedies, histories, and tragedies. These plays
                contain vivid characters of all types. Kings, pickpockets, drunkards, generals, hired killers,
                shepherds, and philosophers all mingle in Shakespeare's works.
                <strong>Shakespeare </strong> has had enormous influence on culture throughout the world. All the things
                he wrote have
                helped shape the literature of all English-speaking countries. He freely experimented with grammar and
                vocabulary and that helped prevent literary English from becoming fixed and artificial.

                            Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
                            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                            And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
                            Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
                            And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
                            And every fair from fair sometime declines,
                            By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
                            But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
                            Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
                            Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
                            When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
                            So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
                            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."</p>
